***Lab 1: Introduction to EEL4712 Digital Design Lab***

**Objective:**
- The objective of this lab is to introduce the software and hardware development tools to be used in EEL4712 to design, construct, and test digital circuits. In particular, you will review the use of Quartus software package from Altera for the synthesis of a digitial design. You will be creating an 8-bit counter using the schematic feature of quartus, and a 4-bit ripple-carry adder using VHDL. Both designs will be synthesized in Quartus and simulated in ModelSim. Also, you will be introduced to the DE10-LITE board, the Digilent Analog Discovery (DAD) and to the techniques of using an oscilloscope and logic state analyzer (LSA) to test a constructed digital circuit.

- Further information will be provided in the Lab 1 Manual pdf
