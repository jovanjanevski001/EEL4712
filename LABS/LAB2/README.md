***Lab 2: Generic-Width Behavioral ALU***

**Objective:**
- The objective of this lab is to creat a generic-width ALU using behavioral VHDL. When mapped to the board, the ALU will use 4-bit inputs and outputs, with outputs mapped to one 7-segment LED. The data inputs to the ALU are connected to four switches, and the 4-bit select input is 1 switch and 3 buttons. In this lab, you will become familiar with two arithmetic VHDL packages: numeric_std (recommended) and std_logic_arith. In addition, you will experience using testbenches to verify the correct functionality of the circuits you specify in VHDL.

- Further information will be provided in the Lab 2 Manual pdf
